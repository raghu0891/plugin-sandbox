[Plugin](https://chain.link/) expands the capabilities of smart contracts by enabling access to real-world data and off-chain computation while maintaining the security and reliability guarantees inherent to blockchain technology.

This repo contains the Plugin core node and contracts. The core node is the bundled binary available to be run by node operators participating in a [decentralized oracle network](https://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaper).
All major release versions have pre-built docker images available for download from the [Plugin dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcontract/plugin/tags).
If you are interested in contributing please see our [contribution guidelines](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
If you are here to report a bug or request a feature, please [check currently open Issues](https://github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0/issues).
For more information about how to get started with Plugin, check our [official documentation](https://docs.chain.link/).
Resources for Solidity developers can be found in the [Plugin Hardhat Box](https://github.com/goplugin/hardhat-starter-kit).

## Community

Plugin has an active and ever growing community. [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/aSK4zew)
is the primary communication channel used for day to day communication,
answering development questions, and aggregating Plugin related content. Take
a look at the [community docs](./docs/COMMUNITY.md) for more information
regarding Plugin social accounts, news, and networking.

## Build Plugin

1. [Install Go 1.22](https://golang.org/doc/install), and add your GOPATH's [bin directory to your PATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)
   - Example Path for macOS `export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH` & `export GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go`
2. Install [NodeJS v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) & [pnpm v9 via npm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm).
   - It might be easier long term to use [nvm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm) to switch between node versions for different projects. For example, assuming $NODE_VERSION was set to a valid version of NodeJS, you could run: `nvm install $NODE_VERSION && nvm use $NODE_VERSION`
3. Install [Postgres (>= 12.x)](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides). It is recommended to run the latest major version of postgres.
   - Note if you are running the official Plugin docker image, the highest supported Postgres version is 16.x due to the bundled client.
   - You should [configure Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ssl-tcp.html) to use SSL connection (or for testing you can set `?sslmode=disable` in your Postgres query string).
4. Ensure you have Python 3 installed (this is required by [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) which is needed to compile solidity contracts)
5. Download Plugin: `git clone https://github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0 && cd plugin`
6. Build and install Plugin: `make install`
7. Run the node: `plugin help`

For the latest information on setting up a development environment, see the [Development Setup Guide](https://github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0/wiki/Development-Setup-Guide).

### Apple Silicon - ARM64

Native builds on the Apple Silicon should work out of the box, but the Docker image requires more consideration.

```bash
$ docker build . -t plugin-develop:latest -f ./core/plugin.Dockerfile
```

### Ethereum Execution Client Requirements

In order to run the Plugin node you must have access to a running Ethereum node with an open websocket connection.
Any Ethereum based network will work once you've [configured](https://github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0#configure) the chain ID.
Ethereum node versions currently tested and supported:

[Officially supported]

- [Parity/Openethereum](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum) (NOTE: Parity is deprecated and support for this client may be removed in future)
- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases)
- [Besu](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu)

[Supported but broken]
These clients are supported by Plugin, but have bugs that prevent Plugin from working reliably on these execution clients.

- [Nethermind](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind)
  Blocking issues:
  - ~https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/issues/4384~
- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon)
  Blocking issues:
  - https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/discussions/4946
  - https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/issues/4030#issuecomment-1113964017

We cannot recommend specific version numbers for ethereum nodes since the software is being continually updated, but you should usually try to run the latest version available.

## Running a local Plugin node

**NOTE**: By default, plugin will run in TLS mode. For local development you can disable this by using a `dev build` using `make plugin-dev` and setting the TOML fields:

```toml
[WebServer]
SecureCookies = false
TLS.HTTPSPort = 0

[Insecure]
DevWebServer = true
```

Alternatively, you can generate self signed certificates using `tools/bin/self-signed-certs` or [manually](https://github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0/wiki/Creating-Self-Signed-Certificates).

To start your Plugin node, simply run:

```bash
plugin node start
```

By default this will start on port 6688. You should be able to access the UI at [http://localhost:6688/](http://localhost:6688/).

Plugin provides a remote CLI client as well as a UI. Once your node has started, you can open a new terminal window to use the CLI. You will need to log in to authorize the client first:

```bash
plugin admin login
```

(You can also set `ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/credentials/file` in future if you like, to avoid having to login again).

Now you can view your current jobs with:

```bash
plugin jobs list
```

To find out more about the Plugin CLI, you can always run `plugin help`.

Check out the [doc](https://docs.chain.link/) pages on [Jobs](https://docs.chain.link/docs/jobs/) to learn more about how to create Jobs.

### Configuration

Node configuration is managed by a combination of environment variables and direct setting via API/UI/CLI.

Check the [official documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/configuration-variables) for more information on how to configure your node.

### External Adapters

External adapters are what make Plugin easily extensible, providing simple integration of custom computations and specialized APIs. A Plugin node communicates with external adapters via a simple REST API.

For more information on creating and using external adapters, please see our [external adapters page](https://docs.chain.link/docs/external-adapters).

## Verify Official Plugin Releases

We use `cosign` with OIDC keyless signing during the [Build, Sign and Publish Plugin](https://github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0/actions/workflows/build-publish.yml) workflow.

It is encourage for any node operator building from the official Plugin docker image to verify the tagged release version was did indeed built from this workflow.

You will need `cosign` in order to do this verification. [Follow the instruction here to install cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/system_config/installation/).

```bash
# tag is the tagged release version - ie. v2.16.0
cosign verify public.ecr.aws/plugin/plugin:${tag} \
      --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
      --certificate-identity "https://github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0/.github/workflows/build-publish.yml@refs/tags/${tag}"
```

## Development

### Running tests

1. [Install pnpm 9 via npm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm)

2. Install [gencodec](https://github.com/fjl/gencodec) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) to be able to run `go generate ./...` and `make abigen`

3. Install mockery

`make mockery`

Using the `make` command will install the correct version.

4. Build contracts:

```bash
pushd contracts
pnpm i
pnpm compile:native
popd
```

4. Generate and compile static assets:

```bash
make generate
```

5. Prepare your development environment:

The tests require a postgres database. In turn, the environment variable
`CL_DATABASE_URL` must be set to value that can connect to `_test` database, and the user must be able to create and drop
the given `_test` database.

Note: Other environment variables should not be set for all tests to pass

There helper script for initial setup to create an appropriate test user. It requires postgres to be running on localhost at port 5432. You will be prompted for
the `postgres` user password 

```bash
make setup-testdb
```

This script will save the `CL_DATABASE_URL` in `.dbenv`

Changes to database require migrations to be run. Similarly, `pull`'ing the repo may require migrations to run.
After the one-time setup above:
```
source .dbenv
make testdb
```

If you encounter the error `database accessed by other users (SQLSTATE 55006) exit status 1`
and you want force the database creation then use
```
source .dbenv
make testdb-force
```


7. Run tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

#### Notes

- The `parallel` flag can be used to limit CPU usage, for running tests in the background (`-parallel=4`) - the default is `GOMAXPROCS`
- The `p` flag can be used to limit the number of _packages_ tested concurrently, if they are interferring with one another (`-p=1`)
- The `-short` flag skips tests which depend on the database, for quickly spot checking simpler tests in around one minute

#### Race Detector

As of Go 1.1, the runtime includes a data race detector, enabled with the `-race` flag. This is used in CI via the
`tools/bin/go_core_race_tests` script. If the action detects a race, the artifact on the summary page will include
`race.*` files with detailed stack traces.

> _**It will not issue false positives, so take its warnings seriously.**_

For local, targeted race detection, you can run:

```bash
GORACE="log_path=$PWD/race" go test -race ./core/path/to/pkg -count 10
GORACE="log_path=$PWD/race" go test -race ./core/path/to/pkg -count 100 -run TestFooBar/sub_test
```

https://go.dev/doc/articles/race_detector

#### Fuzz tests

As of Go 1.18, fuzz tests `func FuzzXXX(*testing.F)` are included as part of the normal test suite, so existing cases are executed with `go test`.

Additionally, you can run active fuzzing to search for new cases:

```bash
go test ./pkg/path -run=XXX -fuzz=FuzzTestName
```

https://go.dev/doc/fuzz/

### Go Modules

This repository contains three Go modules:

```mermaid
flowchart RL
    github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0
    github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0/integration-tests --> github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0
    github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0/core/scripts --> github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0

```
The `integration-tests` and `core/scripts` modules import the root module using a relative replace in their `go.mod` files,
so dependency changes in the root `go.mod` often require changes in those modules as well. After making a change, `go mod tidy`
can be run on all three modules using:
```
make gomodtidy
```

### Solidity

Inside the `contracts/` directory:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

2. Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```
NOTE: Plugin is currently in the process of migrating to Foundry and contains both Foundry and Hardhat tests in some versions. More information can be found here: [Plugin Foundry Documentation](https://github.com/goplugin/pluginv3.0/blob/develop/contracts/foundry.md).
Any 't.sol' files associated with Foundry tests, contained within the src directories will be ignored by Hardhat.

### Code Generation

Go generate is used to generate mocks in this project. Mocks are generated with [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) and live in core/internal/mocks.

### Nix

A [shell.nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell) is provided for use with the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/). By default,we utilize the shell through [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes). 

Nix defines a declarative, reproducible development environment. Flakes version use deterministic, frozen (`flake.lock`) dependencies to
gain more consistency/reproducibility on the built artifacts.

To use it:

1. Install [nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html) in your system.

- Enable [flakes support](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes)

2. Run `nix develop`. You will be put in shell containing all the dependencies.

- Optionally, `nix develop --command $SHELL` will make use of your current shell instead of the default (bash).
- You can use `direnv` to enable it automatically when `cd`-ing into the folder; for that, enable [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) and `use flake` on it.

3. Create a local postgres database:

```sh
mkdir -p $PGDATA && cd $PGDATA/
initdb
pg_ctl -l postgres.log -o "--unix_socket_directories='$PWD'" start
createdb plugin_test -h localhost
createuser --superuser --password plugin -h localhost
# then type a test password, e.g.: plugin, and set it in shell.nix CL_DATABASE_URL
```

4. When re-entering project, you can restart postgres: `cd $PGDATA; pg_ctl -l postgres.log -o "--unix_socket_directories='$PWD'" start`
   Now you can run tests or compile code as usual.
5. When you're done, stop it: `cd $PGDATA; pg_ctl -o "--unix_socket_directories='$PWD'" stop`

### Changesets

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning for libs and the services.

Every PR that modifies any configuration or code, should most likely accompanied by a changeset file.

To install `changesets`:
  1. Install `pnpm` if it is not already installed - [docs](https://pnpm.io/installation).
  2. Run `pnpm install`.

Either after or before you create a commit, run the `pnpm changeset` command to create an accompanying changeset entry which will reflect on the CHANGELOG for the next release.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
